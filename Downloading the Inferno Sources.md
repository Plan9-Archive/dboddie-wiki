# Downloading the Inferno Sources

The Inferno sources are obtained from the [Inferno repository](https://bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os) using Mercurial. At the command line on GNU/Linux or Unix systems, issue the following command:

```
#!bash

hg clone https://dboddie@bitbucket.org/inferno-os/inferno-os
```
The *inferno-os* directory should be created in the current directory.
